# Meetup Events

The Meetup App is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application designed to help users discover and explore various events. It features a list of meetup events with filtering options for online and offline events, making it easy to find relevant gatherings. A search bar allows users to quickly locate specific events by keywords. When a user clicks on an event, they are directed to a detailed view, providing comprehensive information such as date, location, description, and organizer details. This app offers a seamless and interactive experience for event discovery, catering to both virtual and in-person meetups.

Built with a **React** frontend, **Node.js/Express** backend, **MongoDB** database
